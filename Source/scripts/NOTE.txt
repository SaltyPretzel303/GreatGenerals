    "request": "attach",
    "hostName": "localhost",
    "port": 8000

'launch.json' example:
{
	"version": "0.2.0",
	"configurations": [
		{
			"type": "java",
			"name": "Debug (Launch)-Launcher<client-application>",
			"request": "launch",

			"type": "java",
			"name": "attach to mvnDebug",
			"request": "attach",
			"hostName": "localhost",
			"port": 8000
